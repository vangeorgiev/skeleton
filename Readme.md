# Exception Handling for Cosmetics Shop

## Description
You are given a software system for managing a cosmetics shop. The system is already implemented and works. It supports one type of products that can be grouped in categories. The user can:
- Create a category;
- Create a product;
- Add a product to a category;
- Show a category;

## Task
Your **task** is to improve the solution by adding proper **exception handling** which serves the need to validate the user input and provide informative and useful messages. The user input should meet the following requirements.

### 1. Category
- Name should be between 3 and 10 symbols.
- Name should be unique in the system.

### 2. Product
- Name should be between 3 and 10 symbols.
- Name should be unique in the system.
- Brand should be between 2 and 10 symbols.
- Price cannot be negative.
- Gender type can be **"Men"**, **"Women"** or **"Unisex"**.

### 3. Commands
- Each command expects exact number of parameters.
- Each command expects correct parameters in correct format.

## Constraints
- All classes and methods should remain as they are.
- You can define your own exceptions.
- You can add try-catch blocks.
- You should throw proper exceptions with proper messages.

## Additional notes
- Follow the exception handling best practices.
- Throw exceptions where the program can not continues its normal flow.
- Handle exceptions where you can address the problem in the best way.

## Step by step guide

**Hint** There are **TODOs** in the code to help you.

**1.** Define your type of exception(s) that will serve your needs.

- You can start with one custom exception and later add more if you need.

**2.** Implement models fields validation.

**3.** Implement command arguments validations (arguments count and value).

**4.** Add exception handling to `CommandFactoryImpl` class.

- What should happen if the user enters an invalid command?
- What should happen if the enum `CommandType` has commands that don't have a command class?

**5.** Add exception handling to the `EngineImpl` class.
